0.0 Development notes
Fully stable branch can be found at https://github.com/voneiden/ropeclient/tree/0.B-RC1
Please note that development goals have drastically changed since the release of 0.B-RC1.

Currently developing version 0.C

1.0 Installation notes
Ropeclient runs on any nix system that has python 2.x and the following 
dependencies installed:
- Tkinter          Ships with python.
- Twisted          http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/
-- zope.interfaces http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface#download

The win32 builds ship with all the dependencies and python included in 
one convinient package (py2exe). Any patches released on win32 build only
need to replace the executable.

3.0 Usage

3.1 Login
When you login, you're asked for your name. Simply type an user name you wish 
to use. If the name does not exist, you will be asked if you wish to create
a new one. Answering anything beginning with 'y' will result in account
creation process. You'll be asked for a password twice. The password is
hashed client side, so it's fairly safe.

3.2 In-game
Once you're ingame, you'll be just a soul representing your account. You are
most likely situated in the spawn area and the only thing you can do is chat
in the off topic section. You can chat off topic by starting your sentence with
a '(' left bracket. If you simply type text, the game assumes you want to speak it
out loud. However spirits are mute, and thus your text would be automatically
delivered as off topic.

You can switch between two modes of command processing. There's the IRC-style and
MUD-style. In IRC-style all commands are preceded with a '/' slash, except for offtopic '('
and normal talk, which is the default action. The alternative is the MUD-style, which
uses the same commands as IRC-style but without the '/' slash. Off-topic is still '(' left
bracket, however to speak out loud you must use the command 'say', as MUD-style defaults
to no action if it doesn't recognize a command.

After you've spawned, the GM will likely transfer you from your soul to a character so you
can start gaming!
