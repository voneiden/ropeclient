1.0 Quickstart

The wiki page contains basic instructions 
https://github.com/voneiden/ropeclient/wiki so please check there for 
updates on how to use. The homepage http://www.eiden.fi/ropeclient is 
slightly outdated, but contains some win32 builds. 

2.0 Installation
Ropeclient depends on python 2.x, Tkinter and Twisted. 

3.0 Contact
I can be contacted through github for now. Contributors are welcome, 
however the main goal is to keep the core simple. Things that I have 
thought of are multiple chat rooms like in IRC, so the GM can split the 
group into seperate parts, however this I haven't bothered to think too 
much yet. Also thought of some crude Telnet support for users who do not 
wish to use the client for whatever reasons they might have.

4.0 Protocol specification
The protocol is still young, and I will probably stabilize it in the 
near future. Currently the communication goes as follows:

1) Client connects to server
2) Client sends string "SUPERHANDSHAKE". Anything else sent to the 
server causes a disconnect.
3) Client sends 3 variables, SETNAME, SETCOLOR and SETNICK
4) Client is now logged in and added to the game world. Any subsequent 
communication is strings only. The client needs to parse colors. The 
colors are currently always in format
\033<color>. If a color is not supported, it's the clients 
responsibility to deal with it (obviously will not work with telnet)
