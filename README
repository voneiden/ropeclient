0.0 LATEST NEWS

This project is definitely (still) not dead. The code in the master branch is usable 
as is (and was used historically to play quite a few games). However, as is in the spirit of 
this neverending little hobby project a fresh start is again ongoing. Check out the dewdrop 
branch for something completely same but different.

The battlemap branch features a concept of utilizing a 2D map with dynamic light and shadow (and 
field of view) to aid gaming. This branch probably wont be merged anywhere ever, but the idea is 
solid and dewdrop will likely feature something similar.

Dewdrop uses an SQL(ite) database, Pony ORM and Python on the backend. The frontend is built 
with brunch using various goodies that I've enjoyed previously using such as coffeescript, jade 
and stylus.
