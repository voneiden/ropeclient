1.0 Quickstart

The wiki page contains basic instructions 
https://github.com/voneiden/ropeclient/wiki so please check there for 
updates on how to use. The homepage http://www.eiden.fi/ropeclient is 
slightly outdated, but contains some win32 builds. 

2.0 Installation
Ropeclient runs on any nix system that has python 2.x and the following 
dependencies installed:
- Tkinter          Ships with python.
- Twisted          http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/
-- zope.interfaces http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface#download

The win32 builds ship with all the dependencies and python included in 
one convinient (usage wise.. not size wise) package.

3.0 Contact
Primary means of contact either through Github or the mailing list 
ropeclient@googlegroups.com. To subscribe to the mailing list, send an 
email to ropeclient+subscribe@googlegroups.com. The mailing list may be 
used for anykind of ropeclient related discussion, from ideas to issues.


4.0 Protocol specification
The protocol is constantly changing. All major versions are incompatible 
with each others protocol wise. For the time being I have settled with a 
line based protocol, where each message between client and server is 
terminated by a CRLF. Currently an example of the protocol goes roughly 
like follows..

4.1 Connecting to server after connection established.
1) Client  -> Server "hsk SUPERHANDSHAKE [int:protocolVersion]\r\n"
2) Server  -> Client "[string:greeting]"
2) Client  -> Server "nck [string:username\r\n"
3) Client  -> Server "clr highlight [string:color]\r\n"
4) Server  -> Client "pwd [string:passwordRequestGreeting]\r\n"
5) Client  -> Server "pwd [string(sha256hexdigest):password]\r\n"

4.2 Post login communication

Client  -> Server "pit" (player is typing)
Client  -> Server "pnt" (player not typing)
Client <-  Server "pit [string:playerID]"
Client <-  Server "pnt [string:playerID]"
Client <-  Server "lop [playerID1 playerID2 playerIDn]" (list of players)
Client  -> Server "msg [string:content]"
Client <-  Server "msg [string:owner] [float:timestamp] [strint:content]

4.3 Other protocols

Plans exist for other protocols. Main targets will be IRC and telnet. 
This will of course cause some limitations in coloring etc.. So it must 
be thought of still.
