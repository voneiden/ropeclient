1.0 Installation notes
Ropeclient runs on any nix system that has python 2.x and the following 
dependencies installed:
- Tkinter          Ships with python.
- Twisted          http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/
-- zope.interfaces http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface#download

The win32 builds ship with all the dependencies and python included in 
one convinient package (py2exe). Any patches released on win32 build only
need to replace the executable.

3.0 Usage

Please look at the wiki.

4.0 Recent updates
- Support for the Tk client will be dropped as I've chosen to focus on 
the browser client.
- The browser client now features an autocomplete system and no longer 
features the two different input styles. Now we have our own input 
style. To speak, simply write your words. To write offtopic, start your 
sentence with an opening bracket (. To use commands, input the command 
name either fully or partially and press tab. Follow the questions and 
press TAB to move forward or enter to send the command.

- Objects no longer gain an unique number. Instead their referencing ID 
is based on their position in the object list.
