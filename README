1.0 Installation notes
Ropeclient runs on any nix system that has python 2.x and the following 
dependencies installed:
- Tkinter          Ships with python.
- Twisted          http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/
-- zope.interfaces http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface#download

The win32 builds ship with all the dependencies and python included in 
one convinient package (py2exe). Any patches released on win32 build only
need to replace the executable.
