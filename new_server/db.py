    This is now the 3rd complete -from scratch- version of the server.
    The original version was functional, but featured rather hacky code
    and was not really expandable. The second version was designed towards
    a plugin based approach, however it turned out to be rather painful
    to develop as utilizing object-oriented code became increasingly difficult.
    Now I'm after a 3rd version, this time sacrificing the plugin support
    for fast development but with a clean logic. Hopefully this turns out well.

    == Few words on the rope protocol ==

    The protocol between the client and server is pretty straightforward
    The packet starts with a 3-letter command. The most crucial ones are
    msg and pwd. The server to client msg packet looks like this

    msg timestamp owner payload

    And the client to server msg packet looks simply like this
    msg payload

    This time around I plan on implementing also standard telnet protocol.
