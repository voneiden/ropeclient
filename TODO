This is the TODO file that lists things I would personally like to 
tackle next.

******************
* Module support *
******************

- Both client and server should have optional modules. The server may 
enforce certain modules and may disallow the client to connect unless 
such a module is loaded.

- All extended functionality should be put into modules

- Client side module examples: History modification

- Server side module examples: Dice, history modification, etc



-- server should remember previous nick
